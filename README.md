# Season Scheduler

This is an attempt to make a schedule maker given certain rules.

The idea comes from what major sports leagues need to do each year to make optimal schedules.
MLB is going to have a shortened season (hopefully) in 2020. Can I create a tool that would
generate a whole season based on variable data?
